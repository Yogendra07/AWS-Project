# Deploy a Static Website on AWS

## Project Overview
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, deployed a static website to AWS. Firstly, created an S3 bucket, configured the bucket for website hosting, and secured it using IAM policies. Next, uploaded the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, accessed the website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
